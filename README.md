The calculator app helps people do simple math and figure out their Threshold Heart Rate (THR). 
It lets users pick a math task, does the sums, and then offers to find their THR based on how old they are. 
The special part is working out the THR, showing the best heart rate zone for working out.
The main challenge was 'prompt not defined' in VS Code, which I resolved by watching a YouTube video. 
Additionally, I worked to understand the differences between the 'var' and 'let' keywords for variable declaration, which helped structure the code correctly.
